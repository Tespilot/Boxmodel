                <h1>What is a Box Model?</h1>
                <h3> =>  Box model is a container which contains multiple properties including borders, margin, padding and the content itself. It is used to create the design and layout of web pages. It can be used as a toolkit for customizing the layout of different elements. The web browser renders every element as a rectangular box according to the CSS box model. 
                    Box-Model has multiple properties in CSS. Some of them are given below: 
                     
                   <ul>
                       <li>borders</li>
                       <li>margins</li>
                       <li>padding</li>
                       <li>Content</li>
                   </ul>
                    
                    
                     
                    
                     
                    
                     
                    
                    The following figure illustrates the box model. 
                     
                    
                    
                    
                    <br/>
                    Border Area: It is the area between the box’s padding and margin. Its dimensions are given by the width and height of border.
                    <br>
                    Margin Area: This area consists of space between border and margin. The dimensions of Margin area are the margin-box width and the margin-box height. It is useful to separate the element from its neighbors.
                    <br>
                    Padding Area: It includes the element’s padding. This area is actually the space around the content area and within the border box. Its dimensions are given by the width of the padding-box and the height of the padding-box.
                    <br>
                    Content Area: This area consists of content like text, image, or other media content. It is bounded by the content edge and its dimensions are given by content box width and height</h3>
